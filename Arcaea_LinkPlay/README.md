# Arcaea_Linkplay Webhook
The worst Arcaea linkplay webhook utilty ever made (Highly inspired by https://github.com/burritosoftware/arcaea-linkplay-webhook)

## How to use
Configure the dotenv file, and you're good to go.

## Functions
This script sends almost most of the data that is printed from the linkplay server to Discord. It has a simple, and neat Discord Embed Message design. Also, there are some additional datas that could be sent to Discord, but I didn't implement them (Due to laziness). So, if you need, you could code the script, and send them too!
